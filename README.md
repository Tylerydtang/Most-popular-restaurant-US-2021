# Distribution and Sampling
## Total Sales Distribution
Total Sales Distributions are shown below. As expected with sales, the distribution is skewed to the right.

```{r echo=TRUE}
samples <- 5000
sample.size <- 5
xbar <- numeric(samples)

for (i in 1: samples) {
  xbar[i] <- mean(sample(top100chains$X2020.U.S..Sales...000.000., 
                         sample.size, replace = TRUE))
}

plot_ly(x = xbar, type = 'histogram', histnorm = 'probability') %>%
  layout(title="Total Sales Distribution", xaxis = list(
  title = "Total Sales"), yaxis = list(
  title = "Density"))
```


## Central Limit Theorem
Using the total sales attribute in this data set the applicability of the central limit theorem can be shown. As displayed in the histogram above, the distribution is normal. Below are histograms showing the sample means of 5000 random samples of sample sizes 10, 20, 30, and 40 following a normal distribution.

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
cat("Population Mean = 2634.06, SD = 4926,714\n")
options(scipen = 200)
xbar <- numeric(samples)

for (size in c(10, 20, 30, 40)) {
  for (i in 1:samples) {
    xbar[i] <- mean(sample(top100chains$X2020.U.S..Sales...000.000.,
                           size = size, replace = TRUE))
    
  }
  
  hist(xbar, prob = TRUE, col = rainbow(15), xlab = 'Total sales',
       breaks = 15, main = paste("Sample Size =", size))
  
  cat("Sample Size = ", size, " Mean = ", mean(xbar),
      " SD = ", sd(xbar), "\n")
}

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

## Sampling of Total Sales via Simple Random Sample Without Replacement, Systematic Sampling

### Simple Random Sampling
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(sampling)
samples <- 5000
sample.size <- 5
xbar1 <- numeric(samples)

for (i in 1: samples) {
  s <- srswor(20, nrow(top100chains))
  sample.1 <- top100chains[s != 0, ]
  sample_num <- as.numeric(sample.1$X2020.U.S..Sales...000.000.)
  xbar1[i] <- mean(sample(sample_num, size = sample.size, 
                          replace = TRUE))
}

plot_ly(x = xbar1, type = 'histogram', histnorm = 'probability') %>%
  layout(title='Simple Random Sampling', xaxis = list(title = "Total Sales"), yaxis = list(title = "Density"))
```

### Systematic Sampling

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(5966)
samples <- 5000
sample.size <- 5
xbar2 <- numeric(samples)

N <- nrow(top100chains)
n <- 5
k <- ceiling(N / n)

for (i in 1: samples) {
  r <- sample(k, 1)
  s <- seq(r, by = k, length = n)
  sample.2 <- top100chains[s, ]
  sample2_num <- as.numeric(sample.2$X2020.U.S..Sales...000.000.)
  xbar2[i] <- mean(sample(sample2_num, size = sample.size, 
                          replace = TRUE))
}

plot_ly(x = xbar1, type = 'histogram', histnorm = 'probability') %>%
  layout(title='Systematic Sampling', xaxis = list(title = "Total Sales"), yaxis = list(title = "Density"))

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

The numbers are highly condensed with among 0 to 5,000, the Simple Random Sample Without Replacement and Systematic Sampling shows the same outcome.

# Single Element Analysis
## Total Sales for All Chain
```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_ly(x = top100chains$X2020.U.S..Sales...000.000., type = 'histogram',
        histnorm = 'probability') %>%
  layout(title='Total Sales for All Chain', xaxis = list(title = "Total Sales"), yaxis = list(title = "Density"))

2.Above 80% of chain restaurants have sales in 0-5000 thousand.

3.There is no top chain restaurants which sales is in the range from 20,000 to 40,000 thousand.

4.The biggest outlier(McDonaldâ€™s) is so distracted from the average total sales  by 10,00% higher than the mean.

5.The 8 outliers in total sales are too high and pull the average far away from the mean and lower quartiles.

## YOY sales change for All Chain

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot_ly(x = top100chains$YOY.SALES.CHANGE, type = 'histogram') %>%
